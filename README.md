## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project focuses on **customer segmentation** using **K-Means Clustering** and **Hierarchical Clustering**. The goal is to group customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographics, helping businesses personalize marketing strategies and improve customer targeting.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset  
The dataset contains customer details such as:  
- **Age**  
- **Annual Income**  
- **Spending Score**  
- **Purchase Behavior**  

## ðŸ”§ Steps Involved  
1. **Data Preprocessing** â€“ Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Visualizing customer patterns.  
3. **K-Means Clustering** â€“ Applying the elbow method to find the optimal clusters.  
4. **Hierarchical Clustering** â€“ Creating a dendrogram for better insights.  
5. **Model Evaluation** â€“ Analyzing cluster performance and customer segmentation.  

## ðŸ“Œ Technologies Used
